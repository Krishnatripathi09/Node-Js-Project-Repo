"express": "^4.21.2"

when we install a dependency it is installed with some version the first 
digit in version (4) means major update verison which is not backward compatible and it can 
break our app if we install the major verison in our app which is running on minor version
for eg: we are using version 4.x.x in our app and we install 5.x.x version so it represents some major update 
in our app and it could break our application

The second digits (21) represents minor updates which can be installed in our app and wil not do any harm 
The third digits (2) represents patch updates which are also safe to install in our app and will
not do any harm.

(^) symbol means our app can accept minor and path updates without any issue 
(~) symbol means our app avoids version updates that could introduce new features or bugs

while pacakage.json is flexible with installing new minor updates or patch versions but pacakage.lock.json
will install exact version of the app and will not accept any changes in its version minor or major

installed nodemon globally (npm install -g nodemon) to refresh our app as soon as we do some changes in our app
now we run our app using nodemon src/app.js. We can use nodemon from any directory as we have installed 
it globally
